# ðŸ‘‹ Hi friends, I'm Nate

I'm a senior frontend engineer, UI/UX designer, and learner of things and stuff.

I've worked in web, marketing, design, and software engineering for the past 10 years.

While I've worked with many languages over the years (PHP, Elm, C++, and more), I've recently focused more heavily on Javascript and JS based frameworks including React, Angular, Next.js, and, of course, everyone's favorite - Typescript.

While I love to code, I'm equally as passionate about team development, writing exceptional documentation, code reviews/pairing, and strategic planning.

## ðŸ”­ Aspirations

I'm currently working on developing leadership skills, team building, product management, and teaching/mentoring. Long-term, I'm working towards a Staff Engineer position.
